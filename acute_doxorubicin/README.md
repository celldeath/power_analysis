# Power analysis for acute doxorubicin model

Sample size calculations for the acute doxorubicin model were computed using data from a pilot experiment with WT mice treated with saline or doxorubicin. Power calculations were done via bootstrap sampling in order to ensure that the null hypothesis would be correctly rejected with at least 80% power at the 0.05 significance level.
