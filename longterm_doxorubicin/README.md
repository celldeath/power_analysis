# Power analysis for long-term doxorubicin model

Sample size calculations for the long-term doxorubicin model model were computed using data from a pilot experiment with WT mice treated with saline or doxorubicin. The KO mice are assumed to be protected against doxorubicin. Power calculations were done via bootstrap sampling in order to ensure that the null hypothesis would be correctly rejected with 80% power at the 0.05 significance level.
